    production environment where you *know* that

    *extremely* slow check and is not enabled by default,
    intended to be enabled in order to track down (wrong)
    code that uses GL/GLU entry points before the context
    has been initialized (something later Linux GLs are

    OpenGL.error.CopyError if the operation
    would cause a data-copy in order to make the
    passed data-type match the target data-type.
    
    This effectively disables all list/tuple array
    support, as they are inherently copy-based.
    
    This feature allows for optimisation of your
    application.  It should only be enabled during
    testing stages to prevent raising errors on
    recoverable conditions at run-time.

    error, this is intended to be turned on only during
    development so that you can see why something is failing.

    being passed in order to prevent memory-access failures
    if the pointed-to-object goes out of scope.  This
    behaviour is primarily intended to allow temporary arrays
    to be created without causing memory errors, thus it is
    trading off performance for safety.

    To use this flag effectively, you will want to first set
    ERROR_ON_COPY to True and eliminate all cases where you
    are copying arrays.  Copied arrays *will* segfault your
    application deep within the GL if you disable this feature!
    
    Once you have eliminated all copying of arrays in your
    application, you will further need to be sure that all
    arrays which are passed to the GL are stored for at least
    the time period for which they are active in the GL.  That
    is, you must be sure that your array objects live at least
    until they are no longer bound in the GL.  This is something
    you need to confirm by thinking about your application's
    structure.
    
    When you are sure your arrays won't cause seg-faults, you
    can set STORE_POINTERS=False in your application and enjoy
    a (slight) speed up.

    Note: this flag is *only* observed when ERROR_ON_COPY == True,
        as a safety measure to prevent pointless segfaults
