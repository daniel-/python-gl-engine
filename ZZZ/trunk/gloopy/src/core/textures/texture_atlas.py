    """
    creates viewports for all specified textures.
    the viewports will fit the atlas entirely, no empty space but stretched textures.
    the viewport size is calculated by this algorithm,
    so the textures do not have influence on their actual size within the atlas.
    
    the slicing is done in favor for the first elements of the textures list.
    if there are viewports with different sizes, the one more at the beginning
    of the input list will have the bigger viewport.
    
    Some example slices are:
    INPUT     -> ROWS IN ATLAS
    -------------------------- 
    [0]       -> [ [0] ]
    [0,1]     -> [ [0], [1] ]
    [0,1,2]   -> [ [0], [1,2] ]
    [0,1,2,3] -> [ [0,1], [2,3] ]
    and so forth ...
    
    @return: one dimensional list of viewports.
